# url_shrotner.py
url shortner in flask
It will generate a shorter url for URL provided by the user and the generated URL can be used in any browser and the user will be redirected 
to the original website.
It is a very good option for generating short URL to use social networking websites(Facebook, Twitter etc) or in advertisements.

I have deployed it o the amazon EC2.
